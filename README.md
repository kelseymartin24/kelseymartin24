## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi, I'm Kelsey Martin.

🌉 I'm currently located in San Francisco and looking to transition into a fulltime Data Analyst. My prior jobs have always had an element of data analysis and been my favorite projects to work on. 

📈 I have a love database design and data visulization and even enjoy cleaning data and getting deep into the nitty gritty of it.

<h3>TOOLS</h3>
Languages: SQL, Python, Visual Basic</br>
Visualization: Power BI</br>
Database: Learning PostgreSQL and DBeaver</br>
